Diagrams is a powerful, flexible, declarative domain-specific language
for creating vector graphics, using the
[Haskell programming language](http://haskell.org/).

Try it out!
-----------

First, get the
[Haskell Platform](http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/).  Then, issue
the command:

<div align="center">
`cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools diagrams`
</div>

XXX installation instructions on the wiki

See the [tutorial](/tutorial/DiagramsTutorial.html) and the
[user manual](http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams/manual/diagrams-manual.html)
for more detailed instructions, or check out the
[gallery](/gallery.html) for example images and code.

What's so great about it?
-------------------------

Diagrams is:

* *Declarative*: you specify *what* a diagram is, not *how* to draw it.

* *Compositional*: diagrams can be easily combined in many ways to produce
   more complex diagrams.

* *Embedded*: the full power of Haskell, including every library on
   [Hackage](http://hackage.haskell.org), is available to help construct and manipulate graphics.

* *Extensible*: extending diagrams with additional or higher-level
   functionality is as simple as writing a Haskell module.

* *Flexible*: diagrams is designed from the ground up to be as generic
   and flexible as possible.
